# Troubleshooting:

ownership and deletion issues: double click on the ownership.bat and accept with Y. Then delete.

There is no conf/rc file with this set-up. You need to use an lftp script  with your required options and call that in ConEmu. It pretty much works out the same anyway.

If you keep seeing that the lftp script is already running but you know it isn't, check the /tmp folder for and delete the lock file then try again.

# Directories:

The bin directory is home to most of the critical files. You don't really need to go in there, only to update the components.

Your lftp downloads will be saved to the Downloads directory, All included scripts are configured to do this.

To save elsewhere you must use full paths using the Cygwin directory method.

/cygdrive/c/download

translates into:

C:\downloads

Key is where your private key will be stored.

Scripts are stored in the scripts directory and this is where ConEmu will load by default.

tmp is just a temporary folder. you can mostly ignore this directory unless you need to remove the lock file.

# Files:

Most of the critical actions have been configured to run via double clicking some bat files. Here is a run-down of what they will do.

edit - lftpsync.sh.bat will open the included notepad ++ and the lftpsync script for you to edit and save.

edit - connect.lftp.bat will open the included notepad ++ and the connect.lftp script for you to edit and save.

edit - connect.bysh.bat will open the included notepad ++ and the connect.bysh.lftp script for you to edit and save.

edit - connect.feral.bat will open the included notepad ++ and the connect.feral.lftp script for you to edit and save.

edit - connect.whatbox.bat will open the included notepad ++ and the connect.whatbox.lftp script for you to edit and save.

notepad - This will open notepad ++ in the main directory. This will allow you to open a file and be in the portable directory to begin with.

runme will open ConEmu in the script folder but not run or do anything. Aliases have been configured to make running the scripts easy.

lftpsync
connect
bysh
feral
whatbox

runme - lftpsync.sh will run the lftpsync.sh script and automatically minimise ConEmu to the task bar.

runme - connect.lftp will run the connect.lftp script and automatically minimise ConEmu to the task bar.

runme - connect..bysh.lftp will run the connect..bysh.lftp script and automatically minimise ConEmu to the task bar.

runme - connect.feral.lftp will run the connect.feral.lftp script and automatically minimise ConEmu to the task bar.

runme - connect.whatbox.lftp will run the connect.whatbox.lftp script and automatically minimise ConEmu to the task bar.

Usage:

So the idea is this

1: if you have not been provided a customised script by your host then run the edit - connect.lftp.bat and customise it to your details. The run the the runme.bat or runme - connect.lftp.bat

2: If you have been provided a custom script then simple run the relevant bat file if one was provided. If not, then use runme and load the script manually.
